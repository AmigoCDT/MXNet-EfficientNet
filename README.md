# MXNet-EfficientNet
A Gluon Implement of EfficientNet

Sorry guys, I think this implement is bugg now. my training efficient-b0 model size is about 40MB, but it should be 20MB with float32, I'm seeking this bug.
If you know where it is, tell me, please. Thank you all.

## Tmp Usage
I will complete the usage in some days
